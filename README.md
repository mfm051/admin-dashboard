# Admin Dashboard

Simple project to test CSS grid, [part of The Odin Project curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/intermediate-html-and-css-admin-dashboard).
It uses both explicit and implicit units (notably in the projects section), applying the power of CSS grid of adjusting itself based on available space.
